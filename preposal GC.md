# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

1. My main idea is a visual novel based on the video game Fallout New Vegas, made with Ren'py.
2. Another idea I have is an RPG made in RPGMaker, but I am not 100% sure what the topic of it would be.
3. Something to automate the sending of the daily email that I have to send at work.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I'm working by myself.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

How much of my assets can be borrowed from something else, what am I legally allowed to use in my game, etc.
