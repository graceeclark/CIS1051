# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Fallout New Vegas: Visual Novel Fangame

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A visual novel fangame based on the game Fallout: New Vegas.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This will be a visual novel game made in the Renpy engine. It will operate like a basic visual novel, with a choose your own adventure aspect that will be implemented through user prompts that will in turn call functions based on the answer the player gives. It will contain sprites, backgrounds, and music from the original game, repurposed for the visual novel.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A: working alone

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what, I will create a prologue and first section of the game, with sprites and backgrounds.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I will create the prologue, and at least three sections of the game prompted by user input, with sprites, backgrounds, and music.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for the game would be to completely finish the main plot of the game, complete with sprites, backgrounds, and music. I would like 4 endings to match the main endings in the real game.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to become more comfortable with using Renpy, as well as appropriate file management on Windows. I will need to research appropriate syntax and function names on Renpy, as I've noticed it's a little different than regular Python.
